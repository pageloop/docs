Welcome to Pageloop! Once you've set up your account, you'll use three main sections to manage and automate your knowledge base: Home, Drafts, and Updates. This guide provides an overview of each section to help you get started.

## Home Dashboard

Your Home dashboard is the first page you see when you log in. It provides a central hub for getting started and viewing your integration status.

From here, you can:
- **Follow the Setup Checklist:** This guides you through initial configuration steps, like connecting your knowledge base and creating a style guide.
- **Integrate your help center:** Connect Pageloop to your existing help center platform, such as Zendesk, HubSpot, or Mintify. A successful connection is necessary for Pageloop to begin scanning your content.

## Drafts

The Drafts section is where you can create new articles or review articles generated by Pageloop. All your work-in-progress content lives here.

This page displays a list of your article drafts, their current status, and other details. To start a new article from scratch, click the **Create Article** button in the top right corner.

## Updates

The Updates section is where Pageloop's AI identifies opportunities to improve your documentation. After connecting your knowledge base, Pageloop continuously scans your documents for inconsistencies, outdated information, and other potential issues.

Any suggested changes will appear in a table on this page. You can review the proposed updates and decide whether to accept them. To initiate a manual scan for potential updates, click the **Find Updates** button.
