Welcome to Pageloop! This guide will walk you through the primary sections of the applicationâ€”Home, Drafts, and Updates. Understanding these areas will help you use Pageloop to effortlessly create and maintain your knowledge base.

## Home Dashboard

When you first log in to Pageloop, you will land on the Home dashboard. This page serves as your starting point and central hub for getting set up.

From here, you can follow the **Setup Checklist** to guide you through the initial configuration. The first and most important step is to connect your knowledge base by selecting your provider from the **Integrate your help center** section. Connecting your knowledge base allows Pageloop to begin scanning your documents for inconsistencies and potential updates.

## Managing Drafts

You can access all of your in-progress articles from the **Drafts** section in the navigation menu. This area is your workspace for creating new content or working on edits suggested by Pageloop.

The Drafts page displays a table with the following information:
*   **Article Title**: The title of the draft.
*   **Status**: The current state of the draft (e.g., failed, in progress).
*   **Created By**: The team member who created the draft.
*   **Created At**: The date and time the draft was created.

## Tracking Updates

The **Updates** section is where Pageloop's AI-powered analysis comes to life. After you connect your knowledge base, Pageloop continuously scans for outdated content, broken links, and other inconsistencies. When an issue is detected, an update is automatically generated and listed here.

This view provides a clear overview of all pending changes, allowing you to review and approve them before they go live. The table includes details such as which article needs attention, what triggered the update, and when it was detected. If no issues are found, the page will display "No updates found."
