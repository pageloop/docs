Welcome to your Pageloop dashboard. This is your central hub for managing, creating, and updating your knowledge base articles with the power of AI.

The main navigation on the left side of your screen allows you to access three key areas:

- **Home**: Your starting point for setting up Pageloop.
- **Drafts**: Where you can create and manage articles.
- **Updates**: Where Pageloop's AI-driven suggestions appear.

This guide will walk you through each section of the dashboard.

## Home

The Home dashboard is the first screen you see when you log in. It's designed to help you get started quickly. Here you will find the **Setup Checklist**, which guides you through the initial configuration steps.

The main focus of this page is to **Integrate your help center**. Connecting your knowledge base is the first step to allow Pageloop to read your documents and begin suggesting improvements.

## Drafts

The Drafts section is where you can create new articles and manage the lifecycle of your content. This page displays a list of all your articles, showing their **Status**, who they were **Created By**, and when they were **Created At**.

To begin writing a new document, click the **Create Article** button in the top-right corner.

## Updates

The Updates section is where Pageloop's AI suggestions for your connected knowledge base will appear. Once your help center is integrated, Pageloop automatically scans your content for inconsistencies, outdated information, and areas for improvement.

Each suggested update will be listed in a table, showing you what triggered the change and how many changes are pending your review. You can also initiate a manual scan by clicking the **Find Updates** button.
