Smart Search revolutionizes how you find information within the documentation. Powered by AI, it understands the meaning behind your questions to deliver more accurate and relevant results, faster.

## Core Capabilities

Smart Search goes beyond simple keyword matching to provide a more intuitive and effective search experience.

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English, just like you would talk to a person. For example, instead of guessing keywords like `password reset`, you can ask, "How do I reset my password?".

- **Semantic Understanding**: The search engine understands synonyms, related concepts, and the overall intent of your query. This allows it to find the most relevant articles, even if they don't contain your exact phrasing.

- **Instant Suggestions**: As you type, Smart Search provides real-time suggestions and autocompletes your query, helping you formulate the best question and find answers quicker.

- **Advanced Filtering**: Narrow down your search results with powerful filters. You can sort and filter by category, date, or document type to pinpoint the exact piece of information you need.

## Using Smart Search

Finding the answers you need is a straightforward process.

1.  **Start your search**: Click the search bar, which is located at the top of every page.
2.  **Type your query**: Begin typing your question or keywords. A dropdown will appear showing suggested queries and your recent searches.
3.  **Review the results**: On the results page, each entry includes a snippet highlighting why it's a match and a relevance score. If you've made a typo, the system may offer a "Did you mean?" suggestion.
4.  **Refine with filters**: Use the filters on the left sidebar to narrow your results by category, date, or other available criteria.

For the best results, try phrasing your search as a complete question. The AI is designed to understand natural language and will often provide more accurate answers to full questions than to a few keywords.
