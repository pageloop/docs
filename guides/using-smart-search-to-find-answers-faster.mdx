We've upgraded our documentation search to help you find the answers you need more quickly and accurately. Our new Smart Search feature uses AI to understand what you're looking for, providing more relevant results than ever before.

## Key Features of Smart Search

Smart Search goes beyond simple keyword matching. It's designed to understand your intent and deliver the most helpful content.

### Search with Natural Language

You can now ask questions in plain language, just like you would ask a person. Instead of guessing keywords, simply type your full question into the search bar.

For example, you can search for:
- "How do I reset my password?"
- "What are the limits for API requests?"
- "Can I customize the theme colors?"

### Understands Meaning, Not Just Keywords

Our search engine now understands synonyms and related concepts. If you search for "change my login details," it will know to find articles about "resetting your password" or "updating account credentials." This semantic understanding ensures you don't miss important documents just because you used a different word.

### AI-Powered Relevance Ranking

Results are no longer just a list of pages containing your search term. We use a machine learning model to rank each result by relevance. This means the most helpful and applicable articles appear at the top of the list, saving you time. Each result may also display a relevance score to help you gauge its usefulness.

## Using the Search Interface

The search experience is designed to be intuitive and powerful.

### Search Bar and Suggestions

The Smart Search bar is prominently located at the top of every page. As you start typing, a dropdown menu will appear with:
- **Auto-complete suggestions** to help you finish your query.
- **Recent searches** for quick access.

### The Results Page

After you search, the results page provides several tools to help you find the right answer:
- **Highlighted Snippets**: Each result includes a short snippet of text showing why the page is a match for your query.
- **"Did you mean?"**: If you make a typo, Smart Search will suggest a corrected query.
- **Filters**: On the left sidebar, you can filter your results by category, document type, or date to narrow your focus.
